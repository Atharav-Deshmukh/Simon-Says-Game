# Simon Says Game ðŸŽ®
A classic memory game of "Simon Says" built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective is to follow the pattern of lights and sounds for as long as you can. As you progress, the sequence gets longer and more challenging.

# About This Project
As my first real dive into coding, this project was a huge learning experience. My goal was to build a complete, interactive game to practice and solidify my understanding of front-end development. I wanted to create something fun that I could actually play and show to others.

Through this process, I learned how to structure a webpage, style it to make it look good, and most importantly, bring it to life with JavaScript logic.

# Technologies I Used
This project was built entirely with the fundamental trio of web development:

HTML: To create the basic structure and content of the game page.

CSS: For all the styling, including the colors of the buttons, the layout, fonts, and the "flash" animations.

JavaScript: For all the "brains" of the game! It handles starting the game, generating the random sequence, listening for user clicks, and checking for a win or loss.
